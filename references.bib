@article{Heitjan_Rubin_1991, title={Ignorability and Coarse Data}, volume={19}, ISSN={0090-5364}, abstractNote={We present a general statistical model for data coarsening, which includes as special cases rounded, heaped, censored, partially categorized and missing data. Formally, with coarse data, observations are made not in the sample space of the random variable of interest, but rather in its power set. Grouping is a special case in which the degree of coarsening is known and nonstochastic. We establish simple conditions under which the possible stochastic nature of the coarsening mechanism can be ignored when drawing Bayesian and likelihood inferences and thus the data can be validly treated as grouped data. The conditions are that the data be coarsened at random, a generalization of the condition missing at random, and that the parameters of the data and the coarsening process be distinct. Applications of the general model and the ignorability condition are illustrated in a numerical example and described briefly in a variety of special cases.}, number={4}, journal={The Annals of Statistics}, publisher={Institute of Mathematical Statistics}, author={Heitjan, Daniel F. and Rubin, Donald B.}, year={1991}, pages={2244–2253} }

As more and more datasets are generated and accumulated in the public domain, meta-analysis to combine multiple transcriptomic studies to increase statistical power has received increasing popularity. In this article, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to jointly integrate microarray and RNA-seq studies. Since systematic fold change differences across RNA-seq and microarray for detecting differentially expressed genes have been previously reported, we replicated this ﬁnding in several real datasets and showed that incorporation of a normalization procedure to account for the bias improves the detection accuracy and power. We compared our method with the popular two-stage Fisher’s method using simulations and two real applications in a histological subtype (invasive lobular carcinoma) of breast cancer comparing PR+ versus PR- and early-stage versus late-stage patients. The result showed improved detection power and more signiﬁcant and interpretable pathways enriched in the detected biomarkers from the proposed Bayesian model.}, number={7}, journal={Journal of Computational Biology}, author={Ma, Tianzhou and Liang, Faming and Oesterreich, Steffi and Tseng, George C.}, year={2017}, month=jul, pages={647–662}, language={en} }
